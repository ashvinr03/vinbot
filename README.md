current version: [0.0.1] (in development)

vinbot is a discord bot coded in python that utilizes the discord.py API. 
it features moderation commands, role modifications, event triggers, and an unique member interaction system.

test the bot in your server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=901602355437522965&permissions=8&scope=bot

some of the things I learned and practiced during the development of this bot:
- object oriented programming
- discord.py API
- hosting from local server using node
- python 3.9+
- env setup/secrets
